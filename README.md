# GitHub Stuff

## BRANCHES
> Branches are a very important feature in GitHub. We use it a lot when working in a group.

**Always** make sure you are in the right branch before commiting and pushing any files to the repository. You can check which branch you are working in by running `git branch`. This will show you a list of branches, and the branch you are in will be marked with an asterisk:

**If you are on the wrong branch**, you can switch branches by doing: `git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH`
<br>
<br>
## PUSHING AND PULLING CHANGES
> **Pushing your Changes:**
1. **Add all your changes**<br>
You must add all your changes by writing in the terminal: "`add .`"

2. **Commit your changes**<br>
After adding your changes, you can now commit your changes for pushing:
<br>Use "`commit -m "DESCRIBE CHANGES HERE"`"

3. **Pushing changes**<br>
You are now ready to push... Use "`push`" in order to push your changes to the repository.

In summary: <br>
1. `add .` <br>
2. `commit -m "Write a message about your change here"`<br>
3. `push`

> **Pulling Changes:** <br>

Before you are able to push your changes, sometimes GitHub will ask you to pull changes from the repository first. 
<br> run `pull` in order to grab changes made to the repository.

<sub> If any issues occur during any of these processes, pls shoot me a dm and I'll take a look at it asap. </sub>

## Checking the status of the repository
> This will show you all of the files that have not been commited yet. Useful for debugging sometimes.
> 
You can view the status of a repository by running: `git status`
